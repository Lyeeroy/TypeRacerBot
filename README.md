Coded in Autoit



http://play.typeracer.com/

# How to use it:

- Change display format to "Old-Style 2" (Change it before script)

- Press "Hotkey" and paste word to input.


I'm newbie, code is short and full of bugs


# Bugs: I know about:

- If you finish first race and play next, bot doesnt work

- Bot doesnt work in normal display format

- If is in text symbol "!" script cant paste that symbol and basically it stuck on that place, you have to write it manualy

- Button "Start IE" can be pressed just once
