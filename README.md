# TypeRacerBot

TR bot by Lyee

Coded in Autoit

Internet Explorer supported only



http://play.typeracer.com/

# How to use it:

- Change display format to "Old-Style 2" (Change it before script)

- Press "Hotkey" and paste word to input.


I'm newbie, code is short and full of bugs


# Bugs: I know about:

- If you finish first race and play next, bot doesnt work. You have to reload TR page by F5 button

- Bot doesnt work in normal display format

- If in text is symbol "!" script cant paste that symbol and basically it stucked on that place, you have to write to input manually

- ~~Button "Start IE" can be pressed just once (after some races)~~

- Script crash if hotkey is pressed down long time (use "Per word" function instead of hold that key)
