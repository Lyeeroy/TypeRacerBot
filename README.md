I'm newbie, code is short and full of bugs


# Bugs: I know about:

- If you finish first race and play next, bot doesnt work you have to reload TR page by F5 button

- Bot doesnt work in normal display format

- If in text is symbol "!" script cant paste that symbol and basically it stucked on that place, you have to write to input manualy

- Button "Start IE" can be pressed just once
